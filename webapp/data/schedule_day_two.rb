Whether the system is an API, database or source code management system, caching the information can help immensely with performance and the ability to do common tasks such as diff, logging and retrieving/finding data.\n\nI’ve used git to create an easy-to-access cache, and tools to wrap the git functions to enable users to find what they want and easily see differences between different versions. While keeping information in two places can seem inefficient, it’s frequently the case that metadata about “committed” items doesn’t change, and when your SCM, API or database is slow your users can find it very frustrating to find the information they’re looking for. Additionally, these systems aren’t usually tuned for quick retrieval of and comparison of metadata.\n\nI’ve also created a website for accessing this data, making it easy for users to see the information in a convenient form – and having the metadata easy to access means I can also run metrics and show how specific pieces of the metadata have changed over time.\n\nCome discover how you can help your users find the information they need without frustration.",

No matter how well you’ve hardened your infrastructure and put in place failover or self-healing automation, something you didn’t see coming will wreak havoc in your special snowflake of a system. In many cases a human is likely to be a contributing factor. In fact, Gartner has predicted that in 2015, 80% of outages will be caused by people and process issues.\n\nAre you considering the Human element when revisiting incidents and outages with your infrastructure? If so, are you approaching it with a blameless mindset focused on removing the many forms of bias and searching for absolute truth. Do you believe that there is always a root cause to outages or is it more accurate to seek out additional aspects that may have contributed to the incident, especially with regard to the people and processes?\n\nRegardless of your approach, the point of a postmortem is to accurately describe the 'story' about what took place in as much detail as possible. The good, the bad, those involved, conversations had, actions taken, related timestamps, who was on-call, etc. You want to know absolutely everything that took place that was related in some degree so that you can review the data and learn from it.\n\nHow do we ensure that we are asking the right questions and seeking out relevant and important information that will help us understand what took place and ultimately how to become a better team, company, and product as a result?\n\nThe blameless culture (specifically blameless postmortems) is a topic of interest to many in the middle of a DevOps transformation within their organization. I'll outline important best practices for conducting effective postmortems and demonstrate methods to measure benefits from adopting postmortems especially those of a 'blameless' nature.",

Groups shrink for many reasons: attrition, mergers and acquisitions, transfers, and financial distress. It's never comfortable being a Single Point of Failure, but how can you survive this state of non-redundancy? Are there any benefits to being a team of \"me, myself, and I\", or is it all a pit of despair? What kind of red flags should you be on the lookout for? And, most importantly, what compelling leverage can you try to use to encourage team growth back to a reasonable size?\n\nIn this talk, I will share a series of unfortunate events that led to my current status: the Human SPoF; I will also discuss some of the tactics I've used to survive. Automation, tools, and code-as-infrastructure are a force multiplier applied correctly, allowing one engineer to do the work of many. However, these wonders come with a price tag. I will also share strategies to grow a team, and ways to maintain sanity while keeping the lights blinking and the disks spinning in a 24x7 real-time environment with over 2000 servers.",
