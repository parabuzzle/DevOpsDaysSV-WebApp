Each of the techniques has strengths and weaknesses that are illustrated via real-world (anonymized) customer data.  Techniques discussed include deterministic and statistical models as well as uni-variate and multi-variate analytics.  Examples are given that show concrete evidence where each can succeed and each can fail.
This presentation is about concepts and how to think about alternative anomaly detection techniques.  This presentation is not an academic discourse in math, statistics or probability theory.",

Groups shrink for many reasons: attrition, mergers and acquisitions, transfers, and financial distress. It's never comfortable being a Single Point of Failure, but how can you survive this state of non-redundancy? Are there any benefits to being a team of \"me, myself, and I\", or is it all a pit of despair? What kind of red flags should you be on the lookout for? And, most importantly, what compelling leverage can you try to use to encourage team growth back to a reasonable size?\n\nIn this talk, I will share a series of unfortunate events that led to my current status: the Human SPoF; I will also discuss some of the tactics I've used to survive. Automation, tools, and code-as-infrastructure are a force multiplier applied correctly, allowing one engineer to do the work of many. However, these wonders come with a price tag. I will also share strategies to grow a team, and ways to maintain sanity while keeping the lights blinking and the disks spinning in a 24x7 real-time environment with over 2000 servers.",

And how does that work, especially on prepping with new installs/migrations? My aim is to answer those questions, exploring the setup of a configuration management system with a mind’s eye into security and it’s principles, including stories about CloudPassage’s setup with Enterprise Chef Server and the hurdles faced.",
