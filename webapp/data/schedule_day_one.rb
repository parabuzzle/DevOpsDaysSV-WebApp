Each of the techniques has strengths and weaknesses that are illustrated via real-world (anonymized) customer data.  Techniques discussed include deterministic and statistical models as well as uni-variate and multi-variate analytics.  Examples are given that show concrete evidence where each can succeed and each can fail.
This presentation is about concepts and how to think about alternative anomaly detection techniques.  This presentation is not an academic discourse in math, statistics or probability theory.",

It arose from a need for an infrastructure that wouldallow us to continuously deliver applications; that would be appropriate fordistributed systems and a services-oriented architecture; and that facilitatedrapidly prototyping, building, and scaling new features. We went from a coupleof Ubuntu instances with services running in screen to continuous deploymentsusing Docker, CoreOS, Fleet, and custom tooling (soon to be open sourced). Itstars our intrepid heroine, $name, in zir first role as employee #1 at astartup and the entire corpus of Kelsey Hightower's open source contributionsas zir trusty sidekick.\n\nIt's a tale of experimentation, failure, breaking things, rebuilding things,and finally just running things (with scissors). It runs the gamut of emotionsin your typical buddy flick as our stars learn how to run software together. You'll laugh as they try to run Kubernetes in production from day one. You'll cry when they manually rebuild an etcd2 cluster because they have to learn how. You'll be on the edge of your seat when they rebuild an entire AWS infrastructure in 15 minutes. You'll smile when the complete development stack spins up in Docker and no developer ever has to hit production databases again.\n\nThe moral of the story: you don't go from zero to Kelsey Hightower overnight.Understand your needs, and use that understanding to describe the idealtool for the job. Evaluate multiple tools and find the tool or tools with theclosest resemblance that allow you to do the most by doing the least. Thenexperiment until you get it right.",
